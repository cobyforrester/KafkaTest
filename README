From https://kafka.apache.org/25/documentation/streams/quickstart

Java 8 only requirement I believe

to run: 6 terminals required (I know)

clone repository

In this order, all found in RunCommands/

New Terminal
./zookeeper.sh # sets up zookeeper server needed for kafka
New Terminal
./kafka_server.sh # sets up kafka server
New Terminal
./create_topic.sh # creates the topic in question
./word_count_stream.sh # processes from input stream to count words/reduce to key:value (I believe)
New Terminal
./output_view.sh # sets up something to read processed input

Now everything is setup, run ./producer_cust.sh to input custom values
and run ./producer.sh to run the sample.txt file into the stream 
to be processed on a new terminal

cntl-c to quit for every terminal, run ./clean_env.sh to delete the logs and remove topic
to have a fresh environment
