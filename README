Java 8 only requirement I believe

to run: 6 terminals required (I know)

clone repository

All below need their own terminal, in this order, all found in RunCommands/
./zookeeper.sh # sets up zookeeper server needed for kafka
./kafka_server.sh # sets up kafka server
./word_count_stream.sh # processes from input stream to count words/reduce to key:value (I believe)
./kafka_server.sh # sets up kafka server
./output_view.sh # sets up kafka server

Now everything is setup, run ./producer_cust.sh to input custom values
and run ./producer.sh to run the sample.txt file into the stream 
to be processed on a new terminal

cntl-c to quit for every terminal, run ./clean_env.sh to delete the logs and remove topic
to have a fresh environment
